WINDOWS
=======
	- if double clicking the jar doesn't work, try the .exe (it's a wrapper for the jar)
	- might have to do with java nine if you've updated, this is built with java eight.
	- i have no idea why it behaves like this, i can run it on my linux machine but not always on win10.

LINUX
=====
	- just chmod +x on the jar and run it from the console.
