HOW TO RUN THE THING!!!!
========================

The .jar should be runnable but for some it seems it isn't. It worked on my linux laptop but not on my windows workstation.
The .exe is just the .jar packaged for windows, and it SHOULD work. I hope.

We found the jar does not like java 9 for some reason.

Good luck :)
